in this tutorial i will show you how to setup  kali linux and virtualbox.

This guide is about virtualizing Kali Linux inside of VirtualBox, allowing you to have a Kali VM. This is a great way to use Kali, as it is completely separate from the host, allows you to interact with other VMs (as well as the host machine and other machines on the network), and allows you to revert to snapshots.

You may wish to follow our other guide if you are trying to install VirtualBox on Kali Linux (as a host).

The guide below is what we use to generate our pre-made Kali Linux VirtualBox images. You may alter this to your needs. We always generate the images using the latest version of VirtualBox.

VirtualBox Installation

VirtualBox a free and open-source virtualization software by Oracle is used to run various operating systems within your existing Windows 10 environment. This enables you to test new software, explore different operating systems, or even run legacy applications that might not be compatible with your current system.

This guide will walk you through the procedure to install VirtualBox Windows 10 ensuring a smooth and successful setup and an overview of how to use VirtualBox in Windows 10.

Understanding Virtualization
Virtualization essentially creates a virtual machine a software program that mimics a physical computer. This virtual machine can then run its operating system, separately from the host machine. This allows you to experiment with different operating systems without affecting your primary system or provides a safe environment to test untrusted software. Here are some of the key benefits of using VirtualBox:

Install and run various operating systems like Linux, macOS, or older versions of Windows within your Windows 10 environment.
Test new software or applications in a sandboxed environment without risking your main system.
Keep legacy applications that might not be compatible with your current operating system functional.
VirtualBox allows you to allocate specific resources like RAM and CPU cores to each VM optimizing resource utilization.
System Requirements
Before proceeding, ensure your Windows 10 system meets the minimum requirements to run VirtualBox effectively:

64-bit processor.
Minimum 4GB of RAM with at least 2GB allocated for the VM.
300MB Hard Disk for VirtualBox application and additional space for each virtual machine.
Hardware Virtualization extensions are enabled in your BIOS settings.
Enabling Hardware Virtualization might require restarting your system. Refer to our post How to Enable Windows Sandbox in Windows where you can find techniques on how you can verify virtualization.

Installing VirtualBox in Windows 10
Now that you understand the benefits and have checked your system requirements, let’s proceed with the download process:

1. Open your preferred web browser then navigate to the official VirtualBox download page. Under “Windows hosts” click the link to download virtualbox for windows.

Visual Studio Code on Windows
Installation
Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows.
Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). This will only take a minute.



Install and Setup VSCode
Preface/Explanation
VSCode is the text-editor that we support in this class for editing files. We recommend VSCode because it is a feature-rich text editor that has a wide array of different community-made extensions that we use in this course that add useful features to the editor.

Steps
Download and run the VSCode installation from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/
<img width="960" alt="vscodePreDownload" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e90f8d3f-b0cf-4c6e-8799-eac655e3329a">
<img width="960" alt="vscodePostDownload" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be9deaa9-afa8-495c-ba46-37afccfadb81">

First, we will download the required Javascript tools and language support through the welcome page

By default, VS Code is installed under C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code.
Alternatively, you can also download a Zip archive, extract it and run Code from there.

Tip: Setup will add Visual Studio Code to your %PATH%, so from the console you can type 'code .' to open VS Code on that folder. You will need to restart your console after the installation for the change to the %PATH% environmental variable to take effect.
![images](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/256451f2-442d-418c-828e-52efb881ba25)


steps to install and set up Visual Studio Code:

Go to the Visual Studio Code website and download the installer for your operating system.Here


Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install VS Code.
After installation, open VS Code from your system's application launcher.
Customize VS Code by installing extensions for programming languages, themes, and tools.
Configure Git within VS Code or install a Git extension for version control.
Customize your preferences and settings by accessing the "Settings" option.
Start a new project or open an existing one by selecting a folder.
Begin coding, use integrated terminal, and run your programs from VS Code.
Utilize the debugging features by adding breakpoints and running your code in debug mode
User setup versus system setup
VS Code provides both Windows user and system level setups.

The user setup does not require Administrator privileges to run as the location will be under your user Local AppData (LOCALAPPDATA) folder. Since it requires no elevation, the user setup is able to provide a smoother background update experience. This is the preferred way to install VS Code on Windows.

Note: When running VS Code as Administrator in a user setup installation, updates will be disabled.

The system setup requires elevation to Administrator privileges to run and will place the installation under the system's Program Files. The in-product update flow will also require elevation, making it less streamlined than the user setup. On the other hand, installing VS Code using the system setup means that it will be available to all users in the system.

![download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6912af99-f2a1-49c3-b07f-55dfa47a78cf)


See the Download Visual Studio Code page for a complete list of available installation options.

Updates
VS Code ships monthly releases and supports auto-update when a new release is available. If you're prompted by VS Code, accept the newest update and it will be installed (you won't need to do anything else to get the latest bits).

Note: You can disable auto-update if you prefer to update VS Code on your own schedule.
