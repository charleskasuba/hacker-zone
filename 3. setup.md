in this tutorial i will show you how to setup  kali linux and virtualbox.

This guide is about virtualizing Kali Linux inside of VirtualBox, allowing you to have a Kali VM. This is a great way to use Kali, as it is completely separate from the host, allows you to interact with other VMs (as well as the host machine and other machines on the network), and allows you to revert to snapshots.

You may wish to follow our other guide if you are trying to install VirtualBox on Kali Linux (as a host).

The guide below is what we use to generate our pre-made Kali Linux VirtualBox images. You may alter this to your needs. We always generate the images using the latest version of VirtualBox.

VirtualBox Installation

VirtualBox a free and open-source virtualization software by Oracle is used to run various operating systems within your existing Windows 10 environment. This enables you to test new software, explore different operating systems, or even run legacy applications that might not be compatible with your current system.

This guide will walk you through the procedure to install VirtualBox Windows 10 ensuring a smooth and successful setup and an overview of how to use VirtualBox in Windows 10.

Understanding Virtualization
Virtualization essentially creates a virtual machine a software program that mimics a physical computer. This virtual machine can then run its operating system, separately from the host machine. This allows you to experiment with different operating systems without affecting your primary system or provides a safe environment to test untrusted software. Here are some of the key benefits of using VirtualBox:

Install and run various operating systems like Linux, macOS, or older versions of Windows within your Windows 10 environment.
Test new software or applications in a sandboxed environment without risking your main system.
Keep legacy applications that might not be compatible with your current operating system functional.
VirtualBox allows you to allocate specific resources like RAM and CPU cores to each VM optimizing resource utilization.
System Requirements
Before proceeding, ensure your Windows 10 system meets the minimum requirements to run VirtualBox effectively:

64-bit processor.
Minimum 4GB of RAM with at least 2GB allocated for the VM.
300MB Hard Disk for VirtualBox application and additional space for each virtual machine.
Hardware Virtualization extensions are enabled in your BIOS settings.
Enabling Hardware Virtualization might require restarting your system. Refer to our post How to Enable Windows Sandbox in Windows where you can find techniques on how you can verify virtualization.

Installing VirtualBox in Windows 10
Now that you understand the benefits and have checked your system requirements, let’s proceed with the download process:

1. Open your preferred web browser then navigate to the official VirtualBox download page. Under “Windows hosts” click the link to download virtualbox for windows.
